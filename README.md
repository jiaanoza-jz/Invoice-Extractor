DocuMind AI: Intelligent Document Intelligence
DocuMind AI is an advanced document processing application designed to extract and translate information from unstructured files like Invoices, Bills, Challans, and Letters. By combining multimodal AI with a reactive interface, it converts visual documents into structured, actionable data.

How It Works
Document Upload: Users upload a document in image (JPG, PNG) or PDF format.

Multimodal Analysis: The system processes the document as a "vision" task, allowing the AI to "read" the layout, tables, and handwritten notes directly without traditional OCR.

Natural Language Query: Users provide a specific request (e.g., "List all items and their tax amounts").

Structured Extraction: The AI reasons through the document context to find exactly what was requested and returns a clean text or structured response.

Multilingual Specialization
The core strength of DocuMind AI is its ability to handle documents in multiple languages and dialects simultaneously.

Global Extraction: It can accurately extract data from invoices written in languages other than English (e.g., Hindi, Spanish, French, Arabic) without requiring a separate translation step.

On-the-Fly Translation: You can ask the AI to translate the extracted information immediately. For example: "Extract the items from this Japanese bill and list them in English".

Contextual Accuracy: Unlike standard translators, this system understands financial and technical context, ensuring that currency symbols, dates, and specialized terms are translated accurately according to the document type.

Support for 100+ Languages: Leveraging a massive global dataset, the system supports auto-detection and processing for over 100 languages.
